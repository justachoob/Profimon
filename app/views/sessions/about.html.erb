  <h1>About Profimon</h1>
  <h2>Your Mission</h2>
  <p>
    Your mission is to make your characters graduate from SFU with the highest GPA possible.
    Each character will take courses and battle the Profimons in those courses to obtain a grade for each course.
    Characters graduate once they have completed Year 4 and have earned at least 2 badges.
  </p>
  <h2>Moving Up a Year</h2>
  <p>Characters move up a year (i.e. from 1st year to 2nd year) once they have completed 5 courses in their current year.
  <h2>Badges</h2>
  <p>
    You earn a badge for a subject once you have earned 15 points from taking courses in that subject.
    Points for courses are awarded as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>1st year course (100-level): 1 point</li>
    <li>2nd year course (200-level): 2 points</li>
    <li>3rd year course (300-level): 3 points</li>
    <li>4th year course (400-level): 4 points</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: You must obtain a minimum of 50% in a course to receive points for that course.</p>
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>To enroll a character in a course, click <span class="profile_form_button_small_inline">Enroll</span> under the character's info.</p>
  <p>To create a new character, click <span class="profile_form_button_inline">New Character</span> to create one.</p>

  <h2>Select a course for your character!</h2>
  <p>After clicking <span class="profile_form_button_small_inline">Enroll</span>, use the drop-down menus to select a course for your character.</p>
  <p>Note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1st year students only have access to 1st year courses</li>
    <li>2nd year students only have access to 1st and 2nd year courses</li>
    <li>3rd year students only have access to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year courses</li>
    <li>4th year students only have access to 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year courses</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Battle System</h2>
  <p>
  The course will last 10 weeks. You start the course with a grade of 80%.
  For each week, pick one of six skills to use against the Profimon.
  The Profimon will counter with his/her own skill, and your current grade will change
  as a result of how well your skill matched up against the Profimon's skill.
  </p>
  <p>
  The catch is that you don't know what the Profimon will do in each week before you
  select your skill for that week. However, you don't want to be sleeping in during
  the midterm or skipping class when there's a pop quiz!
  </p>
  <h2>The Skills</h2>
  <p>Hover over a skill button to see the attributes for that skill.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #963;">Knowledge:</span>
      This is the knowledge component of the skill. Knowledge is most important when you have pop quizzes, exams, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #963;">Homework:</span>
      This is the homework component of the skill. Homework is most important when the Profimon gives out assignments or projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #963;">Stamina:</span>
      This is the amount of stamina that the skill uses. A negative amount means that you will gain stamina by using this skill.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Midterm</h2>
  <p>The midterm will happen sometime between Week 4 to Week 7 (inclusive). Make sure you study for it!
    <h2>The Final</h2>
    <p>The final will happen in Week 10. You really want to study for this!</p>
    <h2>Receiving a Grade for a Course</h2>
    <p>After the 10 weeks are over, your grade percentage will be multiplied by 4, and this will be your character's grade for the course.
      This value will be counted towards your character's overall GPA.</p>
